Assignment Levels

There are two sets of levels for your robot to attempt:

    Set 1 have a robot that works accurately
    Set 2 has a robot that has inaccuracies built in

You should use the same code across both sets.

Remember: This challenge doesn't save your work, doesn't submit your work, doesn't mark your work. If you are taking this challenge as part of a class's assessment (rather than just finding it out in public), you'll need to submit your code via your class's submission mechanism.

Set 2 is harder than Set 1. This is so that when this is used as a class exercise, there are enough marks in the easier challenge that "perfection" doesn't become the minimum standard.
